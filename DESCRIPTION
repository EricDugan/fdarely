Description: Implementation of reliability measures for functional data. Such methods can be applied to assess the reliability of an experiment whose output is a curve that is evaluated on the same statistical units in multiple test sessions (with at least two sessions, test and retest). Functions to compute functional pointwise reliability indices (ICC, SEM, correlation), their integrated versions, and functional CMC and distance are provided. Details on the definition of such quantities are available in Pini, Markström, Schelin (2019) <doi:10.1080/14763141.2019.1655089> and Schelin, Pini, Markström, Hager (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110546>.
